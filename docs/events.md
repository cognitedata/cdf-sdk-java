# Events

Event objects store complex information about multiple assets over a time period. For example, an event can describe two hours of maintenance on a water pump and some associated pipes, or a future time window where the pump is scheduled for inspection. This is in contrast with data points in time series that store single pieces of information about one asset at specific points in time (e.g., temperature measurements).

An eventâ€™s time period is defined by a start time and end time, both millisecond timestamps since the UNIX epoch. The timestamps can be in the future. In addition, events can have a text description as well as arbitrary metadata and properties.

> Note: To create client see [Client Setup](clientSetup.md)

### Create events

Creates multiple event objects in the same project

```java
List<Event> upsertEventsList = List.of(Event.newBuilder() 
          .setExternalId("10") 
          .setStartTime(1552566113) 
          .setEndTime(1553566113) 
          .setDescription("generated_event_") 
          .setType("generated_event") 
          .setSubtype("event_sub_type") 
          .setSource("sdk-data-generator") 
          .putMetadata("type", "sdk-data-generator") 
     .build()); 
client.events().upsert(upsertEventsList); 
```
 
### Filter all events

Retrieve a list of all events in the same project. 

```java
List<Event> listEventsResults = new ArrayList<>(); 
client.events() 
          .list() 
          .forEachRemaining(events -> listEventsResults.addAll(events)); 

client.events() 
          .list(Request.create() 
               .withFilterParameter("source", "source")) 
          .forEachRemaining(events -> listEventsResults.addAll(events)); 
```

### Aggregate events

The aggregation API allows you to compute aggregated results on events like getting the count of all events in a project or checking what are all the different types and subtypes of events in your project, along with the count of events in each of those aggregations. By specifying an additional filter, you can also aggregate only among events matching the specified filter.

The default behavior, when you do not specify the aggregate field in the request body, is to return the count of events.

 ```java
Aggregate aggregateResult = 
          client.events().aggregate(Request.create().withFilterParameter("source", "source"));
```

### Retrieve events

Retrieves information about events in the same project. Events are returned in the same order as the ids listed in the query.

```java
List<Item> byExternalIds = List.of(Item.newBuilder() 
          .setExternalId("10").build()); 
List<Event> resultByExternalIds = 
          client.events().retrieve(byExternalIds);//by list of items 
List<Event> resultByExternalIds = 
           client.events().retrieve("10", "20");//by varargs of String 

 List<Item> byInternalIds = List.of(Item.newBuilder() 
          .setId(10).build()); 
List<Event> resultByInternalIds = 
          client.events().retrieve(byInternalIds);//by list of items 
List<Event> resultByInternalIds = 
          client.events().retrieve(10, 20);//by varargs of Long
```

### Update events

Updates events in the same project. This operation supports partial updates; Fields omitted from queries will remain unchanged on objects.

```java
client.events().upsert(upsertEventsList); 
```

### Delete multiple events

Deletes events with the given ids. A maximum of 1000 events can be deleted per request.

```java
List<Item> byExternalIds = List.of(Item.newBuilder() 
          .setExternalId("10").build()); 
List<Item> resultByExternalIds = 
          client.events().delete(byExternalIds); 

List<Item> byInternalIds = List.of(Item.newBuilder() 
           .setId(10).build()); 
List<Item> resultByInternalIds = 
          client.events().delete(byInternalIds); 
```
