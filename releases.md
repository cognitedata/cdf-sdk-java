- `Sequences` upsert support including modified column schema. The `upsert` functionality includes both modified `sequences headers`/`SequenceMetadata` and `sequences rows`/`SequenceBody`. For more information, please refer to the documentation: [https://github.com/cognitedata/cdf-sdk-java/blob/main/docs/sequence.md#update-sequences](https://github.com/cognitedata/cdf-sdk-java/blob/main/docs/sequence.md#update-sequences) and [https://github.com/cognitedata/cdf-sdk-java/blob/main/docs/sequence.md#insert-rows](https://github.com/cognitedata/cdf-sdk-java/blob/main/docs/sequence.md#insert-rows)

### Fixed
- File binary upload null pointer exception when running on Android devices.

## [1.13.2] 2022-04-12

### Fixed

- Fix shaded dependencies. Some of the shaded Kotlin libraries caused conflicts when using the SDK from a Kotlin environment.
- Fix duplicated protobuf class files.
- Fix dependency vulnerability. Bump `jackson-databind` to `v2.13.2.1`.

## [1.13.1] 2022-03-22

### Fixed

- File binary download retrying on `SSLException` and `UnknownHostException`. Both may indicate a saturated link for a 
long-running job (which file binary downloads often are).
- Writing `sequence` columns representing integers could cause exceptions.

## [1.13.0] 2022-03-11

### Added

- Files API supports S3 buckets as intermediate store for both read from and write to. 

## [1.12.1] 2022-03-10

### Fixed

- `Files.download()` took a `Path` argument instead of `URI`. 

###

## [1.12.0] 2022-03-09

### Added

- Write string data points. Write requests will chunk strings at 1M UTF8 bytes per request to respect API limits.

### Fixed

- File binary download. Expired URLs not retried properly.

## [1.11.0] 2022-02-18

### Added

- Add utility class `com.cognite.client.util.RawRows` for working with `RawRow` object. Please refer to 
[the documentation](https://github.com/cognitedata/cdf-sdk-java/blob/main/docs/raw.md) for more information.

## [1.10.0] 2022-02-02

### Added

- Added `3D Models Revisions`
- Added `3D File Download`
- Added `3D Asset Mapping`
- `EngineeringDiagrams` promoted from experimental to stable. It has the same signature and behavior as before and is 
located under the `contextualization` family: `CogniteClient.contextualization().engineeringDiagrams()`.
- Added convenience methods to the `Request` object for easier handling of items (by `externalId` or `id`). You can use 
`Request.withItemExternalIds(String... externalId)` and `Request.withItemInternalIds(long... internalId)` to add multiple 
items to the request.
- Added convenience methods for retrieving items by `externalId` and `id`: `client.<resourceType>().retrieve(String... externalId)` 
and `client.<resourceType>().retrieve(String... externalId)`. This is implemented by the resource types `Assets`, `DataPoints`, 
`Datasets`, `Events`, `ExtractionPipelines`, `Files`, `Relationships`, `Sequences` and `SequencesRows`.

### Deprecated

- The experimental version of `EngineeringDiagrams` is deprecated given the new, stable version.
- The single item methods `Request.withItemExternalId(String externalId)` and `Request.withItemInternalId(long internalId)` 
have been deprecated in favour of the new multi-item versions.

### Removed

- The old, experimental `pnid` api. This api has been replaced by the `EngineeringDiagrams` api.

## [1.9.0] 2022-01-04

### Added

- Added `3D Models`
- Increased read and write timeouts to match sever-side values

### Fixed

- Upsert of `sequenceMetadata` not identifying duplicate entries correctly.

## [1.8.0] 2021-12-15

### Added

- Experimental streaming support for `events` and `assets`.
- Added `login status` by api-key

### Fixed

- Upsert of `sequenceMetadata` not respecting the max number of cells/columns per batch.

## [1.7.1] 2021-11-23

### Fixed

- Request retries did not work properly in 1.7.0.

## [1.7.0] 2021-11-22

### Fixed

- File binary upload uses PUT instead of POST

## [1.6.3] 2021-11-22

### Fixed

- Improved robustness for file binary upload. Add batch-level retries on a broader set of exceptions.

## [1.6.2] 2021-11-21

### Added

- Improved robustness for file binary upload. Add batch-level retries when the http2 stream is reset. 

## [1.6.1] 2021-11-18

### Fixed

- Parsing error on file binary download using internal `id`.

## [1.6.0] 2021-11-17

### Fixed

- Retry requests on `UnknownHostException`.
- Retry requests on Google Cloud Storage timeouts.

## [1.5.0] 2021-11-11

### Added 

- Support for `dataSetId` in the `Labels` resource type.

### Fixed

- File binary upload robustness.
- `Labels` using api v1 endpoint.

## [1.4.0] 2021-10-31

### Added

- Support for `ExtractionPipeline` and `ExtractionPipelineRun` so you can send extractor/pipeline observations and 
 heartbeats to CDF.
- Improved performance of `Relationships.list()` with added support for partitions.
- Support for including the `source` and `target` object of a `relationship` when using `list()` or `retrieve()`.
- Improved performance of `Sequences.list()` with added support for partitions.

### Fixed

- More stability improvements to file binary downloads, in particular in situations with limited bandwidth. 
- When trying to upload a `File` without a binary, the SDK could throw an exception if the binary was set to 
 be a `URI`.
- `Relationship.sourceType` was wrongly set equal to `Relationship.targetType`.

## [1.3.0] 2021-10-12

### Added

- Support for interacting with a non-encrypted api endpoint (via `CogniteClient.enableHttp(true)`). 
This feature targets testing scenarios. The client will default to secure communication via https which is the only
way to interact with Cognite Data Fusion.

### Fixed
- In some cases `baseUrl` would not be respected when using OIDC authentication.
- Data set upsert fails on duplicate `externalId` / `id`.

## [1.2.0] 2021-09-13

### Changed

- Refactor the experimental `interactive P&ID` to the new `engineering diagram` api endpoint. Basically, 
`client.experimental().pnid().detectAnnotationsPnid()` changes to `client.experimental().engineeringDiagrams().detectAnnotations()`.
Please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/cognitedata/cdf-sdk-java/blob/main/docs/contextualization.md) 
for more information.

### Fixed

- A performance regression introduced in v1.0.0. Performance should be back now :).

## [1.0.0], 2021-08-18

### Fixed

- More robust file binary download when running very large jobs.
- Improved guard against illegal characters in file names when downloading file binaries.

## [0.9.10]

### Added

represents its columns as `Struct` and `Value`.
- Ability to synchronize multiple hierarchies via `Assets.synchronizeMultipleHierarchies(Collection<Asset> assetHierarchies)`.
- Utility methods for parsing nested `Struct` and `Value` objects. This can be useful when working with CDF.Raw.

### Added

- Synchronize asset-hierarchy capability. 
- `list()` convenience method that returns all objects for a given resource type.
- User documentation.

### Changed

- Breaking change: Remove the use of wrapper objects from the data transfer objects (`Asset`, `Event`, etc.). Please 
refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/cognitedata/cdf-sdk-java/blob/main/docs/readAndWriteData.md#migrating-from-sdk-099) 
  for more information.
- Improved handling of updates for `Relationships`.

- Increased dependencies versions to support Java 11
- Fully automated CD pipeline

## [0.9.7]

### Added

- Labels are properly replaced when running upsert replace for `assets` and `files`.

### Fixed

- Error when trying to download a file binary that only has a file header object in CDF.
- Error when creating new `relationship` objects into data sets.
- Error when uploading file binaries with >1k asset links.

## [0.9.2]

### Added

- Added support for updating / patching `relationship`.

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicates when listing `files`. The list files partition support has been fixed so that you no longer
risk duplicates when manually handling partitions.
