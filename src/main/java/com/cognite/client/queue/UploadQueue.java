/**
 * The UploadQueue batches together items and uploads them to Cognite Data Fusion (CDF), both to minimize
 * the load on the API, and also to improve throughput.
 *
 * The queue is uploaded to CDF on three conditions:
 * 1) When the queue is 80% full.
 * 2) At a set interval (default is every 10 seconds).
 * 3) When the {@link #upload()} method is called.
 *
 * The queue is always uploaded when 80% full. This happens on a background thread so your client can keep putting items
 * on the queue while the upload runs in the background.
 *
 * The upload interval trigger must be explicitly enabled by calling the {@link #start()} method. This starts a
 * background task that triggers a queue upload at a configurable interval. The default interval is every 10 seconds.
 * The trigger interval works in combination with the fill rate interval--this is the recommended way to use the
 * queue. When you are done using the queue, you should call {@link #stop()} for proper cleanup of background tasks
 * and draining the queue.
 *
 * You can also trigger an upload manually by calling {@link #upload()}. This is a blocking function.
 *
 *
 * @param <T> The CDF resource type to upload.
